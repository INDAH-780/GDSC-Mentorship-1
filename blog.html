            <p>Even though the Illinois legal system has developed a sophisticated process for handling complaints of sexual harassment, many people still endure this unacceptable behavior at work and are unsure how to handle it. Worries about embarrassment in front of colleagues, a desire to avoid confrontation, and/or a fear of retaliation often keep people from speaking up about sexual harassment when it happens. Sometimes, it can be difficult to recognize that inappropriate behavior is sexual harassment until after the fact. </p>
            <span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more">
            <p>However, it is essential to speak up and take action when you feel that are being sexually harassed. There are many reasons for this, not least of which is that what offends one person may not necessarily offend another, and the person bothering you may not realize they are doing so. At the same time, it is important not to let someone continue bothering you simply because they state they do not intend to sexually harass you. </p>
            <h3>What is Sexual Harrasement</h3>
            <p>While sexual harassment can manifest in many different ways, it is important to know that all sexual harassment is gender-based employment discrimination, and it is against the law. The law puts sexual harassment into two basic categories: Quid pro quo (the exchange of sexual favors for employment benefits) and hostile work environment (when sexual harassment is so extreme that it is abusive or interferes with someone being able to do their job). </p>
            <p>Sexual harassment can be explicit or subtle. Your boss may not outright state that he expects sexual favors in return for a raise, but he can imply it in many different ways. Likewise, a colleague may send out an email to the entire office that contains a lewd joke or photograph, knowing you will find it offensive but expecting no pushback simply because they have never gotten any. </p>
            <p>The somewhat subjective nature of sexual harassment can make it difficult to identify behaviors that always constitute harassment, because everyone is different. However, if you feel bothered or offended by a behavior, you should take action. </p>
            <p>If you did not take action at the time of the offense, this does not mean you should continue to stay silent. You still have a legal right to be free from sexual harassment at your job and you should assert this right.</p>

            <br>
            <p> Sexual harassment in the workplace has become a hot button issue in recent years. After celebrities such as Harvey Weinstein and Matt Lauer were publicly scrutinized for accusations of workplace sexual harassment, more and more people started taking notice of the issue.</p>
            <span id="dots"></span>
            <span id="more">
            <p>As an employee, it is crucial that you understand your rights under Illinois and federal law. Many workers unknowingly allow discriminatory and offensive behavior to go unchecked because they are not aware of the rights and the legal safeguards designed to protect them. This allows perpetrators to continue their unlawful behavior and avoid being held accountable for their misconduct. Unfortunately, discriminatory practices tend to proliferate if nothing is done to stop it, which is why it is so important for employees to speak up.</p>
            <h3>Employees Have a Right to Be Free from Discrimination and Harassment</h3>
            <p>As an employee, you have the right to be free from discrimination on the basis of sex, race, color, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, or national origin. Under the Illinois Human Rights Act, employers are required to provide a workplace free from any form of unlawful discrimination. This includes sexual harassment.</p>
            
            <p>MYFIRM law defines sexual harassment as “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” which creates an intimidating or hostile environment for employees. Sexual innuendos, cruel remarks, teasing, jokes, and nonconsensual touching, if severe or pervasive, may constitute sexual harassment. “Quid pro quo” arrangements were an employer or authority figure attempts to gain sexual or romantic benefits in exchange for work-related benefits are also considered sexual harassment.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Employees Have the Right to Be Free from Retaliation</h3>
            <p>Another crucial issue with regard to sexual harassment claims is the threat of retaliation. Many people who are harassed or discriminated against at work do not report it because they are worried they will be fired or otherwise punished for speaking up. Fortunately, the law specifically protects employees against retaliation. If you file a sexual harassment complaint and face retaliation, you have a right to file a claim for compensation.</p>
