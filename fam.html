            <h2>Divorce</h2>
            <p>
                Making the decision to get a divorce can be one of the most important and emotional choices you will ever make. The process is often more difficult and more emotionally charged when children are involved. An experienced family law attorney from our firm can help you approach the emotional, financial, and legal matters involved in a divorce in a rational manner.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Child Support</h3>
            <p>In Illinois there are clearly defined guidelines for child support, and courts take the enforcement of child support orders seriously. It is often helpful to consult with an experienced child support attorney to learn your rights as you address these matters. Whether you are the person receiving support or the person making payments, you will want to be sure child support orders are establshed correctly that will cover your children's onging needs, including their basic daily expenses and additional costs related to education, child care, medical treatment, or extracurricular activity</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Custody and Visitation</h2>
            <p>For parents, many of the most important issues to address during a divorce case will involve their children. It is important to ensure that parents will be able to have strong, ongoing relationships with their children, and children's best interests should be protected in any decisions that are made. While parents may do their best to reach agreements regarding child custody, there are some cases where disputes may not be able to be resolved amicably. If necessary, a trial may be held, and a judge may determine how outstanding issues will be resolved. Our skilled attorneys work to help our clients resolve conflicts related to these issues. We take steps to ensure that children's best interests are protected as parents negotiate parenting plans.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Marriage</h3>
            <p>In some cases, couples may fail to realize that marriage is a legal agreement between two adults that functions in a similar manner as a contract. Before getting married, couples should be sure to understand their rights and obligations and the issues that may affect them, their property, and their finances in the future. Consulting with a family law attorney prior to marriage can provide a better understanding of these issues, and it can help couples determine whether they should take steps to protect themselves or plan for the possibility of divorce. We can provide guidance on whether it may be beneficial to create a prenuptial agreement or address other legal concerns prior to becoming legally married to your partner.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Adoption</h3>
            <p>An adoption involves someone other than a child's biological parent being declared as the child's legal parent. Adoption cases require court approval, and before a child may be legally adopted, a home study will need to be performed to ensure that they parent is fit and capable of providing the necessary care. We can assist with multiple types of adoptions, including step-parent adoptions, international adoptions, and foster child adoptions. </p>
