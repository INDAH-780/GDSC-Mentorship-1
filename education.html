            <h1>EDUCATION LAW</h1>
            <p>If you have received a notice that your child is subject to disciplinary action from their school, this is a matter that must be taken seriously. If your child is expelled, they may have trouble being admitted into another school, putting their academic career and their future in jeopardy. If your child is facing a suspension or expulsion, you need an experienced Illinois school law attorney by your side aggressively advocating for your childâ€™s rights and best interests.</p>
            
            <p>At Mirabella, Kincaid, Frederick & Mirabella, LLC, our attorneys have extensive experience helping students who may have made a mistake get their lives back on track. Attorney Stacey McCullough handles our school law cases. Attorney McCullough is a seasoned litigator with in-depth knowledge of Illinois statutes and the school system. She is a skilled, tenacious, and compassionate student advocate, and works closely with parents and students to ensure the most favorable outcome possible in school disciplinary proceedings.</p>

            <span id="more">
            <h3>The Disciplinary Process in Illinois Schools</h3>
            <p>The school board establishes policy guidelines on the administration of pupil discipline with the assistance of a parent-teacher advisory committee, and in accordance with state and federal law. A copy of these guidelines must be furnished to the parents or guardian of each pupil within 15 days following the start of the school year, or within 15 days after classes begin for a transferring student. Many school districts also post-disciplinary guidelines online.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Alternative Educational Options after Expulsion</h3>
            <p>If your child is expelled from school, the school district may place him/her in an alternative school. In some cases, this could occur prior to the expulsion hearing. If your child is placed in an alternative school, an education plan must be developed as soon as possible between the two schools along with a date in which the child can return to the school they were expelled from.</p>
            <p>Generally, a student who is expelled from one public school district is not considered to be in good standing in another district. This usually leaves only two options; enrollment in an alternative school (if one is available) or enrollment in a private school. Acceptance into a private school may be difficult, however, because most private schools also require the student to produce a certificate of good standing.</p>
